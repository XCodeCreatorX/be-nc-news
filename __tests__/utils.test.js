// This utility function should be able to take an array (list) of objects and return a new array. Each item in the new array must have its timestamp converted into a Javascript date object. Everything else in each item must be maintained.

//hint: Think carefully about how you can test that this has worked - it's not by copying and pasting a sql timestamp from the terminal into your test

//Test Ideas:
// - Empty Array --> Empty Array

// - Does not mutate original array / creates a new array of objects
// - Converts the timestamp into a javascript data object
// - Does not change anything else within the objects

// new Date()
